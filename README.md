# Signature-Recognition
Offline Handwritten Signatures is the basic and most used form of Identification/Verification. This requires high manual work, which is in this case often not reliable as it depends on the person. So there is a requirement for a classifier which compares a real signature and an unknown signature, and determines correctly if the unknown signature is Real or Forged.
